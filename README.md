# LanguageCoordination
This code simulates the communication of shared procedural abstractions, between two individuals, the architect and the builder. Over repeated trials the architect tries to communicate actions to the builder. The architect's decisions are affected the success of any expression to map the correct action as well as by the expression's length.  
The simulation framework is based on McCarthy et al., (2021), arXiv:2107.

#Run the script
1. Clone this repository
2. Open Matlab 
3. Run script LanguageActionCoordination (approximate running time ~5min, creates two figures)
   i) To explore different assumptions affecting the interaction of the 'architect-builder dyad' open script LanguageActionCoordination and change 'Bias' (switch between 0 (=random sampling) and 1 (=weighted sampling)).
   ii) To explore the effect of procedural tasks switch between options provided for the 'action'+'dictionary' pair.
